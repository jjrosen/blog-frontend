        Okay, hear me out: water has had a free pass for way too long. It’s
        everywhere, it’s in everything, and everyone says we “need”
        it—suspicious, right? Think about it: water ruins phones, floods
        basements, frizzes hair, and sneaks into your shoes at the exact wrong
        moment. It hides in the sky as rain, attacks as waves, and shows up
        uninvited in the form of sweat whenever you’re trying to look cool. And
        don’t even get me started on the taste—because yes, water somehow tastes
        different everywhere you go, and half the time it tastes like sadness.
        So maybe it’s time we stop blindly trusting the world’s most overrated
        liquid and start asking the real question: is water actually the villain
        of our daily lives?
